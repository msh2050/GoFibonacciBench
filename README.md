# GoFibonacciBench

Benchmarking deferent Fibonacci functions and algorithms with running unit test ...

## Introduction:
Fibonacci numbers are special kinds of numbers that form a special sequence. This sequence is one of the famous formulas in mathematics. You can find Fibonacci numbers in plant and animal structures. These numbers are also called nature's universal rule, and nature's secret code.

Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of whole numbers arranged as:-

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```

## what we bechmark
there are so maney code in the net to get Fibonacci number but I thing I can do better

## method
1. collect the methodes used to get Fabonacci in go
2. run unit test to check and correct (some function start form 1 not 0)
3. check function limitation
4. benchmark
5. try to make/modify/inhance for best results
